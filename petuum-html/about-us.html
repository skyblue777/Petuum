					<h2>Petuum's mission</h2>

					<p class="petuum-m">is to make even the most advanced AI technology accessible and affordable by everyone who needs it.</p>

					<p class="petuum-ms">We provide a flexible Machine Learning platform and interface for all industries and markets across the board. We enable vertical AI and ML solutions in healthcare, utilities, manufacturing, telecommunications, internet, autonomous driving, and beyond.</p>

					<h3>About Petuum</h3>

					<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">

						<p>Today’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions are expensive, high-maintenance, skill-intensive, and difficult to repro-duce and mass distribute. Such so-lutions are also extremely specialized in their applications and functions, and rely on maintenance by a select few developers. AI is currently inaccessible to those who would benefit from it the most.<br>Petuum's mission is to virtualize and standardize AI and ML programming and computing, and transform it into a simple-to-use, transparent, repeatable, and everyday tool for all enterprises.</p>

						<p>There has been limited adoption of AI and ML in enterprises from a broader industry perspective, and Petuum aims to dramatically improve the adoption rate by lowering the barrier to AI and ML solutions. </p>

					</div>

					<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">

						<p>By virtualizing a standard set of AI and ML components and turning them into a commodity, Petuum is lowering the cost of ownership and making these solutions readily accessible and deployable across industries.</p>

						<p>AI and ML software cannot be limited to one-off, task-specific products created by corporate research and development labs. By democratizing access to a standardized, customizable general AI software platform, Petuum is enabling the eventual integration of AI into the foundation of every industry, driving higher productivity, better service, lower costs, and faster delivery.<br>Petuum’s goal is not only to democratize the processes underlying the creation of AI systems, but to put practical AI into the hands of any and every organization that needs it.</p>

				                    		<label>Director of DL R&D</label>

				                    		<p>Dr. Graham Neubig is Director of Deep Learning Development at Petuum, Inc., and an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, Language Technologies Institute, and a former Assistant Professor at Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST).</p>

				                    		<p>Prof. Neubig’s research is concerned with language and its role in human communication, with the goal of breaking down barriers in human-human or human-machine communication through the development of natural language processing (NLP) technologies. In particular, he focuses on several aspects of language which hold potential for the construction of practical systems. Specific areas of interest include Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing (Text Analysis, Language Modeling, Parsing), Machine Learning (Neural Networks, Un- and Semi-supervised Learning, Bayesian Methods), Spoken Language Processing (Spoken Language Analysis, Spoken Dialog), Software Language Processing (Conversion/Alignment between Code and Language). Prof. Neubig has authored over 100 papers, with over 1,300 citations in total, and 5 best/outstanding paper awards.</p>

				                    		<p>He is the co-head of and top committer on the DyNet open source Deep Learning system, which outperforms Google Tensorflow on Natural Language Processing applications.</p>
